# CubeBacktrackingSolver
# Description
3D Cube Solver is a Java application that employs a backtracking algorithm to fill a 3x3x3 cube according to specific rules. Each cell within the cube can hold a value between 1 and 5, and the solver attempts to place these values in such a way that no row, column, or depth (z-axis) contains duplicate numbers.

# Features
Implements a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
Validates each entry based on cube constraints to ensure no duplicates along any row, column, or z-axis.
Provides visualization of the cube's state at completion or during debugging.
